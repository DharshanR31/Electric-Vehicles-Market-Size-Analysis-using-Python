Market size analysis is a crucial aspect of market research that determines the potential sales volume within a given market. It helps businesses understand the magnitude of demand, assess market saturation levels, and identify growth opportunities. So, if you want to learn how to perform a market size analysis of any product, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll take you through the task of Electric Vehicles market size analysis using Python.

## Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis: Process We Can Follow
Market size analysis for electric vehicles involves a multi-step process that includes defining the market scope, collecting and preparing data, analytical modeling, and communicating findings through visualization and reporting. Below is the process you can follow for the task of electric vehicles market size analysis:

Define whether the analysis is global, regional, or focused on specific countries.
Gather information from industry associations, market research firms (e.g., BloombergNEF, IEA), and government publications relevant to the EV market.
Use historical data to identify trends in EV sales, production, and market.
Analyze the market size and growth rates for different EV segments.
Based on the market size analysis, provide strategic recommendations for businesses looking to enter or expand in the EV market.
So, we need an appropriate dataset for the task of market size analysis of electric vehicles. I found an ideal dataset for this task. You can download the dataset from [here](https://github.com/DharshanR31/Electric-Vehicles-Market-Size-Analysis-using-Python)
## Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis using Python
Now, let’s get started with the task of electric vehicles market size analysis by importing the necessary Python libraries and the [dataset](https://github.com/DharshanR31/Electric-Vehicles-Market-Size-Analysis-using-Python):

So, this data is based on the EV population in the United States.


For the task of market size of electric vehicles analysis, we can explore the following areas:

1. EV Adoption Over Time: Analyze the growth of the EV population by model year.
2. Geographical Distribution: Understand where EVs are most commonly registered (e.g., by county or city).
3 EV Types: Breakdown of the dataset by electric vehicle type (BEV, etc.).
4. Make and Model Popularity: Identify the most popular makes and models among the registered EVs.
5. Electric Range Analysis: Analyze the electric range of vehicles to see how EV technology is progressing.
6. Estimated Growth in Market Size: Analyze and find the estimated growth in the market size of electric vehicles.

Let’s start with analyzing the EV Adoption Over Time by visualizing the number of EVs registered by model year. It will give us an insight into how the EV population has grown over the years:

From the above bar chart, it’s clear that EV adoption has been increasing over time, especially noting a significant upward trend starting around 2016. The number of vehicles registered grows modestly up until that point and then begins to rise more rapidly from 2017 onwards. The year 2023 shows a particularly sharp increase in the number of registered EVs, with the bar for 2023 being the highest on the graph, indicating a peak in EV adoption.

Now, let’s start by selecting the top 3 counties based on EV registrations and then analyze the distribution of EVs within the cities of those counties:
